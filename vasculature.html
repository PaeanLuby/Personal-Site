                Vascularization is crucial for meeting the brain’s metabolic demands. Previous
                research on rats in enriched environments indicates a positive correlation between
                environmental complexity and cortical microvascular density (MVD; Sirevaag et al.,
                1988). Recently, our lab observed increased neural cell counts and elevated stress
                hormones in wild-caught rats from Richmond, VA compared to weight-matched
                Long-Evans laboratory rats (Jacob et al., 2022). Building on these initial results, we
                compared MVD in wild female rats (R.norvegicus) with laboratory-bred R.
                norvegicus. (n=5 each group) in the current study. Focusing on brain regions
                implicated in emotional and cognitive functions, namely the hippocampus and
                anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), we hypothesized that wild rats would have higher
                MVD scores due to the complexity of their natural habitat compared to their
                laboratory counterparts. Fresh brains were post-fixed upon removal and sectioned at
                40 μm for immunocytochemistry to quantify mineralocorticoid receptors, an
                antibody known to mark blood vessels. Results indicated that the wild rats had
                approximately 60% higher visible immunoreactive vasculature scores than the lab
                rats in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (p=.016) and approximately
                260% higher scores than the lab rats in the ACC (p=.004). Because natural habitats
                are complex with both engaging and threatening stimuli, the second phase of this
                study examined the impact of laboratory-induced environmental enrichment on
                cerebrovasculature via immunofluorescence procedures targeting Collagen IV, a
                marker for the basal lamina of blood vessels. There was no
                significant difference in vascular density between rats anticipating positive experiences and rats who did
                not experience anticipation in the hippocampus. Given that exploration in an enriched environment is linked 
                to higher brain blood flow, this lack of a significant difference could hint to anticipation not being a necessary 
                element of environmental enrichment for maintaining healthy vasculature. However, it is also possible that the
                anticipation and enrichment experiences were not prolonged enough for such changes to emerge. Together, these results will help
                elucidate the influence of complex, dynamic environments on the brain’s MVD,
                with translational potential for cerebrovascular disease outcomes.

                Enriched environments, or sensory stimulating environments, have been around since the 1960s
                in rodents, and have been shown to be highly conducive to promoting neuroplasticity following
                a neural insult. However, in clinical settings, these environments are difficult to standardize
                and implement because of their cost and complexity. Virtual reality could help address both
                of these disadvantages, allowing for enriched environment protocols to be reproducible across patients
                and accessible to the general public. For this reason, this summer, I designed and implemented a preclinical
                study comparing virtual and physical versions of enriched environments with the same novel stimuli. My 
                investigation’s behavioral data suggests that the virtual environment changed the rats’ openness to 
                explore in the same way as the physical environment. This semester, I am analyzing the 
                vasculature and neural circuitry of these rats’ visual cortices, somatosensory cortices, 
                and hippocampi to infer possible neuroscientific bases for these similarities, along with using machine learning to 
                further quantify rodent behavior.

               I used a combination of projectors, image, and video-editing software to construct the virtual environment.

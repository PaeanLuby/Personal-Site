            <h3>Phase 1</h3>
            <p>
                    Attachment theory describes behaviors in affectionate relationships, such as parent-infant bonds. 
                This project expanded attachment theory’s application to sibling relationships through 2 inquiries: 
                “Does sibling status impact attachment within sibling and caregiver relations?” and “Does sibling 
                status impact emotional development within sibling and caregiver relations?” Prior research and 
                personal assumption suggested twins have a stronger attachment/ emotional bond than singletons. 
                Because adolescence is an important developmental stage, twins (n=26) and singletons (n=26) ages 
                12 to 18 were recruited using convenience sampling. Using a frequency-based Likert scale, 
                participants completed an anonymous 48-question survey developed by the researcher to measure 
                attachment and emotional development with their sibling and caregiver from their perspective. 
                Two-tailed t-tests were used to measure raw scores for the attachment construct and means and 
                standard deviations were calculated for each group. Overall, concerning attachment (12 items), 
                singletons and twins were found to attach to their sibling to a similar extent (p>.05). However, 
                singletons were found to have a higher attachment to their caregiver than twins (p&lt;.05). 
                A chi-square test was used to measure emotional development items and degrees of freedom
                were calculated for each group. Concerning emotional development (8 items), no difference 
                in frequency of dominance, social dependence, or conflict was found for twins and singletons 
                (p>.05). These results suggest that society’s differing treatment of twins and singletons, 
                at least within the adolescent stage, is inconsistent with the dynamics of these interpersonal 
                connections, supporting the recent biopsychosocial shift in parenting multiples as individuals.

            <h3>Phase 2</h3>
            <p>
                Twinship has been recognized as interfering with the separation-individuation process, 
                in which familial dependency is reduced for individual development. One way in which 
                experts have approached this complication is by promoting twin treatment similar to 
                that of nontwins. Where their agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of 
                what constitutes this treatment, and how it affects emotional well-being into adolescence 
                and beyond. Twins (n=29) and nontwins (n=25) ages 13-19 were recruited using purposeful sampling. 
                Participants completed a 20-question survey developed by the researcher to collect quantitative 
                and qualitative information about sibling individuation, empathy, sympathy, and enmeshment. Pearson’s 
                chi-squared tests (χ2), Fisher’s exact tests, odds ratios, and associations were applied to sets of 
                categorical data to measure frequencies for the individuation and enmeshment constructs. For the embedded 
                qualitative questions about empathy and sympathy, 6 themes emerged from 75 significant statements.  
                Experiences of empathy and sympathy in sibling relationships encompassed achievement, punishment, health, 
                peer relationships, adjustment, and general. Concerning individuation, twins were found to share a room, be 
                compared by others, have the same friends, and dress alike in childhood significantly more often than their 
                nontwin counterparts (p&lt;.05). In spite of these less individualistic treatments, no sibling status-based 
                differences in enmeshment-related behaviors were found (p>.05). However, associations were found between 
                certain forms of collectivist treatment and frequency of comparisons, which twins claimed negatively 
                affected their twinship. These results suggest that some individuation strategies emphasized by twin 
                experts are not as central to promoting intersibling well-being as others less widely emphasized, such as 
                avoiding comparisons.
